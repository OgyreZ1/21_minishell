# minishell
I programmed my own unix shell that can execute all programs from PATH and also several builtins such as "cd", "echo", "exit".

I learnt a lot about processes, file descriptors and signals

to compile execute command:
```
make
```

to run minishell execute command:
```
./minishell
```
after executing you'll see minishell prompt:

Here you can execute almost every command you want to. Also you can use pipes ("|"), redirects ("<", ">", "<<", ">>").
